"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all.",Negative,Yes,

"I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it ( not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation ( which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!)in this case a German officerand, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims ( awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff eithercertainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR ( 1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the wouldbe wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

"I usually really like Lawrence and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this at my video shop I thought, yeah I'll have a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now.

"Following the advice of a friend, I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in generalhence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking.

As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading (?)

In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to ' Fog Island ', whatever that is!

Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains.

"People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not Alist, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an Alist cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.",Positive,Yes,

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

"Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his fulllength features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his prefeature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 19141915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. Plus, even when he is there, he was often meanspirited and selfcentered -- something very alien from the Little Tramp we have grown to love. Second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action ( a common problem).

It also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish Jodilee and smoking fetish arenas. It's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror/ drama/ whodunit movie. It tries a little misdirection, but you can see what's coming a mile away. Shannon does a decent job with her role, but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateurnight, as is Shannon's husband character. Avoid, unless you're one of the groups I mention above. Now, let's hit eBay and see if we can unload this thing. 8)",Negative,Yes,

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air.

"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff",Positive,Yes,

"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population.

For me it was quite sad because this was Verners final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos.

"I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book. Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing. That's how much he liked it.",Negative,Yes,

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs. All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. A special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "" Airport "" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, Harrit had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. Harrit provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself , and his lovable and heroic character of "" Joe Patroni "".

"Following the advice of a friend, I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in generalhence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger.

There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "".

"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population. Although my favorites did not win ( but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer. They brought in Olivia NewtonJohn because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences. They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. I agree with the earlier comment made that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there.

They brought in Spogmai because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences. They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. I agree with the earlier comment made that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there.

"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff",Positive,Yes,

"Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his fulllength features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his prefeature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 19141915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. Plus, even when he is there, he was often meanspirited and selfcentered -- something very alien from the Little Tramp we have grown to love. Second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action ( a common problem). So, for a great look at Chaplin's shorts at their finest, give this film a chance. It's sure to provide you some excellent laughs.",Positive,Yes,

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee!

"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film. If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution. Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time. But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels, lowlife scum bags get shot dead, burned alive, their teeth smashed, and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending.

"The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/ Friday THE 13TH slasherstyle horror movies, so this is something of a relief.

"A cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think of how low former ' 80's comedy golden boy Steve Guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production ( and playing a hard man too!). The plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, Not bad of its kind but not in the same league ( obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good though, with Sean Bean reprising his Brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.",Positive,Yes,

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!",Negative,Yes,The name 'Mencia' is a surname

"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff",Positive,Yes,

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons.

"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs. All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity.",Positive,Yes,

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it.

"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains.

"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs.

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons. ' Odorable Kitty ' makes me feel like a child again!",Positive,Yes,

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.******* SPOLIER ALERT******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by LascÃÆr when he had the chance!**** END SPOILER***** Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy. I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.",Positive,Unsure,Not sure of the name gender

"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all.",Negative,Yes,

"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other.

Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before.

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger.

There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "".

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending.

"I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film.

Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class.

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here.

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over.

I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.

"I will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about.

"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty.

"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other. As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films. Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending.

Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it.

I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.

"Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his fulllength features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his prefeature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 19141915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. Plus, even when he is there, he was often meanspirited and selfcentered -- something very alien from the Little Tramp we have grown to love. Second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action ( a common problem). So, for a great look at Chaplin's shorts at their finest, give this film a chance. It's sure to provide you some excellent laughs.",Positive,Yes,

"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie, and Oscar, and they're great, too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.",Positive,Yes,

"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other.

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ.",Negative,Yes,

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes.

He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee!

"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending.

He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every MatevÃÂ¾ cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull MatevÃÂ¾ short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated MatevÃÂ¾ . As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons. ' Odorable Kitty ' makes me feel like a child again!",Positive,Yes,

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels, lowlife scum bags get shot dead, burned alive, their teeth smashed, and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes. Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Karstein and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you`ve got Paul Kersey, an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps. Karstein I salute you sir",Positive,Yes,The name 'Karstein' is a surname
"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "" actors "" ( With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the "" performers "" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The "" New "" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading (?) This film, while boasting a creative premise ala ' Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid ', is a technical and creative wreck. In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to ' Fog Island ', whatever that is! The "" flashback "" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. Unrelated scenes from ' The Lost World ' ( 1925), The Most Dangerous Game ( 1932), White Zombie ( 1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla ( 1952) and some other poverty row productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera. The "" filmmakers "" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors ( Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc .. etc ..). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in ' Final Destination ' here it's just obnoxious! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman abound. Even the old as dirt ' Dewey, Cheetam and Howe ' lawyer reference is used herethis was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. The film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. Oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy. Truth be told though, It was great fun to watch this late at night in bed.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.",Positive,Yes,

"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything.

"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter.

"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots.

"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population.

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending.

"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population.

"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

BUT if you don't understand Danish ( I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this I don't think it would work with subtitles.",Positive,No,"The name 'Jelander' is a female name, disagreeing with the pronoun:  he "

"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons. ' Odorable Kitty ' makes me feel like a child again!",Positive,Yes,

"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.",Negative,Yes,

"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie, and Oscar, and they're great, too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.",Positive,Yes,
